# AI Flashcards

## Inspiration
Our inspiration for this project came from websites such as **Quizlet**, which allow users to create flashcard sets and study them engagingly. Unfortunately, many of these sites now require payment to access their features. Thus, we aimed to develop our version of Quizlet, which is both **easy to use** and **accessible to all**. We were also intrigued by **ChatGPT** and quickly integrated it into our project.

## What It Does
Our project includes two mediums for creating and studying flashcards:

### Mobile Application
- **Manual Flashcard Creation**: Input both the question and answer.
- **AI-Assisted Flashcards**: Generate flashcards automatically by entering a question and using ChatGPT to respond.
- **Flashcard Management**:
  - View all flashcards.
  - Edit existing cards if needed.
  - Sort cards into piles for studying or mastery.

### Website
The website has three main tabs:
1. **Add Cards Manually**:
   - Create flashcards with a front and back side.
   - List and view all created cards.
2. **Generate Cards**:
   - Use ChatGPT to generate a set of flashcards on a specific topic.
3. **Study All**:
   - Display one flashcard at a time.
   - Click to reveal the other side.
   - Use navigation buttons to move forward and backward through the set.
